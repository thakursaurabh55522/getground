/*
This diagram shows the same Kubernetes architecture as before, but with the addition of the tools used in the deployment process. In this architecture, the Golang application and Redis are still deployed as containers and managed by Kubernetes. However, the containers are built with Docker and the deployment process uses Kubernetes tools like kubectl and Helm.

The load balancer distributes incoming traffic to multiple instances of the application, and Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and updates of the containers. The Docker containers are built with the necessary dependencies and configurations, including the password-protected Redis instance.

Note that this is just one possible architecture and there are many other ways to deploy the application on Kubernetes with different tools. The exact details of the architecture will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the available infrastructure.
