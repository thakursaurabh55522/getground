Architecture
The proposed architecture consists of the following components:

Kubernetes cluster: used to manage the deployment and scaling of the application and Redis. It can be set up using a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud Platform, or a self-hosted solution like kubeadm.
Redis: used to store the state of the application. It can be deployed as a stateful set in Kubernetes, with persistent volumes to ensure data persistence.
Golang application: the core of the solution, it serves a single endpoint that increments a counter for each call and returns the current count. It can be containerized and deployed as a deployment in Kubernetes, with multiple replicas to ensure high availability.
To secure Redis, we can use a password and set it as a Kubernetes secret, which can be mounted as an environment variable in the Redis container.

Implementation
Here are the steps to implement the solution:

Set up a Kubernetes cluster. You can use a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud Platform, or a self-hosted solution like kubeadm. Make sure you have kubectl and the necessary CLI tools installed.
Create a Redis password and store it as a Kubernetes secret:
lua
Copy code

kubectl create secret generic redis-password --from-literal=REDIS_PASSWORD=<password>

Deploy Redis as a stateful set in Kubernetes, with persistent volumes:
Copy code

kubectl apply -f redis.yaml

Build and containerize the Golang application using Docker. You can use the Dockerfile provided in the repository:
perl
Copy code

docker build -t my-app .

Push the Docker image to a registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry:
bash
Copy code

docker tag my-app <registry>/my-app:latest
docker push <registry>/my-app:latest

Deploy the Golang application as a Kubernetes deployment, with multiple replicas and a load balancer service to expose it to the outside world:
Copy code

kubectl apply -f app.yaml

Test the application by accessing the endpoint http://<load-balancer-ip>/:id, where <load-balancer-ip> is the external IP of the load balancer service. You should see the counter increment for each call.
